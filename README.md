# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Introduction

This project performs customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers based on their purchasing behavior. The implementation is done in Python with scikit-learn and includes data visualization using matplotlib.

## Usage

### Steps to Use:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/VIKRAM2563/CustomerSegmentation-KMeans-MachineLearning.git
     cd CustomerSegmentation-KMeans-MachineLearning
     ```

2. **Open the Notebook:**
   - Open the Jupyter notebook (`Customer_Segmentation_Using_KMeansClustering.ipynb`) directly from the repository link.

3. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Execute each cell in the notebook to perform data preprocessing, model training, and visualization.

## Model

- **Algorithm:** K-Means clustering.
- **Steps:** Data preprocessing, model training, clustering, visualization.

## Results

- Cluster analysis and visualization of customer segments.
